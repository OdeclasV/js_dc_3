###Objects: 

- To store data. Let us describe 'real world' stuff in programming.  
- Objects are made of properties. A property is a key value pair.  
- If the property of an object is a function, that's a *method*  
- The dot notation has some limitations. For instance, you can't have a method that starts with a number, ie myObject.2.  
- Not recommended to have a key that's a number.   
- There's no order to an object  
- Symbols: same as key?  
- 

###JSON 
- Can't do methods  
- Can't do symbols   


###This
- An instance of an object is constructed by this.myObjt  
- Construction function: mechanism to get different instances of an object  
- Class: our way to define a constructor
